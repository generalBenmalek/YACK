# Notification Reference

Push notifications rely on Firebase Cloud Messaging via `sendNotification`. Each message targets the *other* contract participant whenever a user performs a relevant action. All notifications share this envelope:

```json
{
  "title": "Human readable subject line",
  "body": "Short description",
  "data": {
    "type": "<eventIdentifier>",
    // Additional type-specific keys
  }
}
```

To receive notifications a `User` document must contain at least one valid `fcmTokens` entry.
